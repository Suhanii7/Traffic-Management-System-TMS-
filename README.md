# AI-Powered Smart Traffic Analyzer
### Surveillance-Based Real-Time Traffic Monitoring and Automated Incident Detection System

This project is an AI-driven traffic monitoring system that processes CCTV or surveillance camera feeds to automatically detect vehicles, track movement, compute traffic analytics, and highlight unusual behavior. It reduces the need for continuous manual monitoring and supports faster, data-driven decision-making for traffic management and patrolling units.

---

## Project Goal

The system is designed to automate traffic monitoring by:

- Using surveillance cameras as the main data source
- Detecting and counting vehicles in real time
- Tracking each vehicle using unique identifiers (DeepSORT)
- Identifying suspicious or unusual road activity
- Calculating congestion levels, lane occupancy, density, and approximate vehicle speed
- Reducing dependence on manual surveillance
- Creating the foundation for an automated alert system for faster incident response

---

## Key Features

- Real-time vehicle detection using YOLOv8
- Reliable multi-object tracking using DeepSORT
- Automatic logging of analytics into an SQLite database
- Live dashboard for traffic visualization
- Supports both video files (MP4) and webcams
- Computes:
  - Car, truck, bus, motorcycle counts
  - Total traffic volume
  - Average speed (pixels/second)
  - Congestion level
  - Lane occupancy
  - Vehicle density
- Helps detect:
  - Accidents
  - Sudden halts or stoppages
  - Wrong-way driving
  - Suspicious vehicle movement
  - Unexpected congestion buildup

# File Descriptions

### 1. traffic_detection.py — Core AI Module
Responsible for:
- Running YOLOv8 detection  
- Tracking vehicles using DeepSORT  
- Counting vehicle types  
- Displaying annotated frames  
- Inserting analytics into the database  
- Handling webcam and video file input  

---
